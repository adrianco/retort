# Future experiments — prioritized queue

The live queue of what to run next, highest priority first. When an experiment finishes (or a
model candidate is rejected), its write-up moves to [`past-experiments.md`](past-experiments.md)
in increasing experiment order, and it comes off this queue.

**Workflow (CLAUDE.md):** before launching any experiment, write its plan / hypothesis here and
push; verify every tuning parameter takes effect with a smoke test first; after it lands, run
`retort recover` + `retort aggregate`, update the blogs, and move the entry to past-experiments.

**Current best local stack:** Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B via Hermes + oMLX at `context_threshold: 0.9`
("full context") — Python/Go/TypeScript all 1.00, Rust 0.33 (near-misses → cloud), niche languages
~0.00, hard task 0/6 (config-invariant). The 35B is the faster Python/Go alternative (0.85). See
[optimal-blog.md](../optimal-blog.md).

## 1. Graphify tooling factor + large-existing-codebase task  — PLANNED (top priority)

Add a third level to the `tooling` factor (currently `none` / `beads`): **`graphify`** — a
code knowledge-graph skill ([graphify.com](https://graphify.com/),
[GitHub](https://github.com/Graphify-Labs/graphify)). It uses Tree-sitter + LLM extraction to turn
a repo into a queryable graph (`graph.json` + `GRAPH_REPORT.md` + god-node/blast-radius analysis)
so the agent answers questions about *relationships* instead of grepping. **Code extraction is
offline/no-API-key** (dogfooded on retort's own `src/`, 1292 nodes in ~20s); it ships a Claude Code
skill (`graphify install`) and an MCP server (`graphify-mcp`) — the two integration points the
experiment needs.

**Hypothesis (task-size interaction, not a mean shift).** Graphify's value is *comprehending an
existing large codebase*. On greenfield **bookshop** it should be a no-op/slightly negative (nothing
to graph). It should pay off on **brazil-bench** and, most of all, on the **large-existing-codebase
task** below — the regime Graphify targets.

**The paired large-codebase task (user decisions, 2026-07-17):**
- **Language: Python.**
- **Scoring: BOTH** — (a) req-coverage over the *new* capabilities the modification must add,
  layered on the seeded codebase, AND (b) a **no-regression gate**: the seed's existing test suite
  must still pass. This is a new scorer shape (bookshop is from-scratch only) — the gate must run
  the pre-existing suite against the modified tree and fail on any breakage. **Build/verify that
  regression gate before trusting results.**

**Design.** `task × tooling{none, beads, graphify}` on brazil-bench + the new large-codebase task
(one bookshop arm as the negative control). Hold the model fixed at a strong cloud stack first (to
isolate the tooling effect from local capability noise), then repeat on the local 80B.
n≥3/cell; pass = req-coverage.

**Plumbing to build + VERIFY first (a set-but-unverified tool is worse than none):**
1. A pre-run hook that builds `graphify-out/` in the playpen before the agent starts. Code-only =
   no key; the graph reflects the *seeded* code (built once for comprehension).
2. Expose it to the agent (mount `graph.json` + `GRAPH_REPORT.md` with instructions, or wire the
   Graphify MCP server so the agent queries it live).
3. **Smoke-test that the agent actually consults the graph** (grep the transcript for graph
   reads / MCP calls) — else `graphify` is silently identical to `none` and we publish a false null.
4. Confirm token accounting captures the claimed savings.

**Graph-freshness design point:** Graphify doesn't auto-update — `graphify update <path>` refreshes
only changed files (offline, fast). The graph built pre-run is for comprehending the *existing*
code; as the agent edits, it drifts. Default: build once at the start (the agent knows its own new
code; it needs the map of what's already there — where ~all the value is for a modify-existing
task). Optionally test re-running `graphify update` between turns as a second arm.

*Dogfood retort itself as the first Graphify target when building this — it validates the plumbing
and gives a maintained graph for future work.* Per incremental-experiments: add ONLY the new tooling
level / task; don't re-run existing cells.

## 2. exp-41 — self-repair iteration-2 on the 80B ctx-0.9 near-misses  — SCAFFOLDED, ready to launch

Scaffolded at `experiments/adrianco/experiment-41-repair-80b-fullctx/` (m80 preset now uses the
`context_threshold: 0.9` field). Launch with `retort run --repair-from
experiments/adrianco/experiment-38-alllang-80b-fullctx/bookshop` on the near-miss languages
(rust/java/erlang), n=3.

**Key framing (discovered while analysing exp-38/39):** the default inline **second-chance already
does one feedback-driven repair** on every failing cell (confirmed via the `_second_try` metric —
set on all exp-38 near-misses). So our reported near-misses (Rust 0.917, hard-task python 11/12) are
*already post-one-repair*. exp-41 therefore tests **iteration 2**: does a second dedicated repair
pass, seeded with the iteration-1 code + a fresh FEEDBACK.md, close the last 1-2 requirements?

**Headline:** Rust at 0.92 (missing ~1 requirement) is the most-likely-to-flip and highest-value —
if a repair pass takes Rust from 1/3 to 2-3/3, **Rust becomes locally viable** on the 80B. java
(0.75) / erlang secondary. The all-zeros niche languages are excluded (no coherent code to repair).
Repair runs are `prompt=repair`, half-credit, excluded from the headline pass-proportion.

## 3. Inference-lever sweep — remaining tiers (issue #40)  — OPEN

The sampling tier is done (exp-27). Remaining levers, by payoff:
- **Speculative decoding / MTP** — the top speed lever. Our runs are generation-bound, so faster
  tok/s converts wall-crashes and slow-but-terminating runs (esp. the 80B, and Rust/Go) into
  passes. oMLX 0.5.0 ships a Qwen3.5/3.6 MTP patch, but the unsloth 4-bit build has no MTP weights →
  needs a small draft model. Highest payoff, most setup.
- **Quant level (4-bit → 6/8-bit) and scheme (unsloth/bartowski/stock)** — tests the hard-task
  *capability* ceiling: is the last mile (Go reaches 0.92 req_cov but not 1.0) lost to 4-bit quant
  error? A 6-bit 35B (~26 GB) fits 64 GB.
- **MoE vs dense** (issue #40 ask) — a fair matched-size dense-vs-MoE on Hermes to isolate the
  architecture effect (the Devstral attempt was the wrong harness).
- **Deprioritised, with reason:** K/V + context quant (memory levers; context isn't our bottleneck
  and lossy KV risks reliability); SWA / convRot (research-y, weak serving support).
- **Meta-prize:** log each config's pass-proportion alongside its published perplexity → *which
  inference levers move real coding reliability, and how badly perplexity mispredicts it.* No public
  benchmark answers this.

## 4. gpt-oss-20b — the one remaining fits-64GB new-model candidate  — LOW priority

The only untried model that both fits and isn't a Qwen3.5 VLM. Fits comfortably; **Harmony**
tool-format (oMLX has a `harmony` reasoning parser, tool-parse unverified — needs a gate-probe).
20B is unlikely to beat the 35B, so low priority — but it's a different lineage (OpenAI open
weights) and the only clean new-model probe left. To try a Mistral-family or Devstral coder instead,
the stack manager would need a llama.cpp / vLLM serving backend (they parse the Mistral tool format
oMLX can't).

## Candidate models to test next

New open-weight coding models found by the daily scan that plausibly fit 64GB at 4-bit; promote to a
numbered experiment when prioritised.

- *(none currently queued — the daily scan appends here. **Laguna XS 2.1** was gate-probed
  2026-07-21 and is BLOCKED: its `laguna` arch isn't in mainline oMLX/llama.cpp yet (support PRs
  unmerged) — see past-experiments.)*

**Serving backends:** retort now supports **`serving.backend: omlx | llamacpp`** (2026-07-21). The
llama.cpp path (`llama-server`, Metal-native, GGUF, `--jinja` tool templates) serves models oMLX
can't — any GGUF whose arch + tool format are in *mainline* llama.cpp. It unblocks **Devstral**
(Mistral arch/parser are mainline) but NOT Laguna (arch unmerged). To add vLLM later (broadest
tool-parser incl. `poolside_v1`), extend `make_stack_manager` with a third backend — note vLLM's
Metal support is weak, so it suits a CUDA box, not this Mac.

## Standing method notes

- **Incremental design:** add ONE new model/factor at a time; run only the new cells; compare
  against `master.db`. Never re-run existing baselines.
- **Spec-gate always ON.** Clean archive bloat (truncate `_agent_stdout.log`, strip
  node_modules/target) before committing.
- **Self-repair second-chance is the universal default** (every task, every run) — don't opt out
  with `--no-second-chance` unless asked. It repairs *completed-but-failed* runs; *crashes*
  (wall-timeouts) don't get it, so raise the timeout to convert crashes into repairable runs.
- **Timeout is per-experiment and LOCAL runs need more time** (local models are slow). Set
  `playpen.timeout_minutes` generously (~60 min local vs ~30 cloud). It's a property of the stack,
  not the task.
- **After each experiment:** `retort recover` + `retort aggregate`, update the blogs, move the
  write-up to [`past-experiments.md`](past-experiments.md), push.
- **Suspect the harness before the model:** a model that produces *no code* looks identical to a
  blocked file-write tool. Run `retort diagnose` on any surprising zero; `retort recover` cleans up
  the scorer TOOLING false-failures after every local run.
